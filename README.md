GeneticHelloWorld

The GeneticHelloWorld program is a Java-based implementation of a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of random strings towards a perfect string. This genetic algorithm uses selection, crossover (breeding), and mutation to iteratively improve the fitness of the strings in each generation until the perfect string is achieved.

Prerequisites

To run the GeneticHelloWorld program, you will need the following:

    Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
    A Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a text editor to edit and compile the code.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the GeneticHelloWorld program:

    Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

    Open the project in your Java IDE or use a text editor to view and edit the source code.

    Compile and run the GeneticHelloWorld.java file. This is the main class that contains the genetic algorithm implementation.

Usage

Once the program is running, it will evolve a population of random strings towards the target "perfect" string. The key parameters and behavior of the program are defined in the code:

    PERFECT_STRING: The target string that the algorithm aims to evolve towards.

    GENERATION_SIZE: The size of each generation (number of strings).

    SURVIVOR_SIZE: The number of strings that survive from one generation to the next based on their fitness.

    MUTATION_CHANCE: The probability that each string in a generation will undergo mutation.

    GENERATION_COUNT: The number of generations the algorithm will run.

The program will output each generation of strings, sorted by their fitness score, along with the fitness scores themselves. The goal is to observe the evolution of the population towards the perfect string over multiple generations.
Algorithm Overview

The GeneticHelloWorld program uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of strings towards a perfect string. The algorithm follows these steps:

    Initialization: The initial generation of random strings is generated.

    Evaluation: The fitness of each string in the generation is calculated by comparing it to the perfect string.

    Selection: The top-performing strings (survivors) are selected to form the next generation.

    Crossover (Breeding): Pairs of survivors are selected to create offspring through crossover (mixing of genes).

    Mutation: Each string in the new generation has a chance to undergo mutation, where a random character is changed.

    Repeat: Steps 2 to 5 are repeated for a specified number of generations.

    Output: The program outputs each generation's strings and their fitness scores.

    Termination: The algorithm stops after a fixed number of generations.
